# Codex Quick Config: Design and Decisions

## 1. Background

Codex originally had a *static* config flow: the backend
`ApplyCodexConfig(baseURL, models)` wrote every managed field with
hardcoded values (`model_provider`, `wire_api="responses"`,
`model_reasoning_summary="auto"`, `model_supports_reasoning_summaries=true`,
the `[profiles.*]` blocks), and the `CodexConfigModal` only showed a
read-only preview plus an "Auto Config" button. Users couldn't tune any
Codex option.

This redesign brings Codex up to parity with the Claude Code Quick Config
(see `claude-code-config.md`): the modal now has **Quick** and **Manual**
tabs, the Quick tab is a typed form of model/reasoning knobs, and the
Manual tab previews the real, server-rendered files. Scope is deliberately
limited to **model / reasoning / profile** keys — no `approval_policy` /
`sandbox_mode` safety toggles, no network-retry tuning.

---

## 2. Goals

1. **Editable, discoverable.** Each tunable Codex key is a labeled row with
   a one-line purpose, a hover tooltip (valid values + Codex default + tb
   recommendation), and the literal `config.toml` key shown as a code badge.
2. **Server-rendered preview.** The Manual tab's TOML/JSON comes from the
   backend (`POST /config/preview/codex`), so what the user previews is
   byte-for-byte what Apply writes — including prefs stamped into each
   profile.
3. **Safe for third-party providers.** tingly-box mostly proxies *non-OpenAI*
   models. Defaults must not assert OpenAI-only capabilities the upstream
   model doesn't have.
4. **Catalog is opt-out, and visible.** The model catalog (which makes
   tingly models show up in Codex's `/model` picker) is an explicit toggle,
   and its contents are shown in the Manual tab so copy-paste users aren't
   left with a dangling file reference.

---

## 3. Typed prefs, whitelist by construction

Unlike Claude Code (whose JSON tags are env-var names), Codex prefs map 1:1
to `config.toml` keys. The struct *is* the whitelist — only these four keys
can ever be set from a request, so prefs can never clobber tingly-managed
fields (`model`, `model_provider`, `model_catalog_json`,
`model_providers.*`) or inject arbitrary TOML:

```go
// internal/config/apply_config.go
type CodexPrefs struct {
    ModelReasoningEffort            string `json:"model_reasoning_effort,omitempty"`
    ModelReasoningSummary           string `json:"model_reasoning_summary,omitempty"`
    ModelVerbosity                  string `json:"model_verbosity,omitempty"`
    // Catalog-only (not config.toml keys; see §"Schema alignment" below):
    SupportsReasoningSummaries      string `json:"supports_reasoning_summaries,omitempty"`
    EffectiveContextWindowPercent   string `json:"effective_context_window_percent,omitempty"`
    AutoCompactPercent              string `json:"auto_compact_percent,omitempty"`
}
```

All values are strings; `""` means *omit this key, let Codex use its own
default*. This avoids the "0/false means unset" ambiguity. `toConfig()`
converts to native TOML types with enum-membership validation (invalid →
dropped) and `"true"` → `true` (anything else dropped).

Prefs are written **both** at the top level (global default) and into each
generated `[profiles.<model>]` block, so every tingly profile is
self-contained.

## 4. Conservative defaults (the third-party decision)

The original code hardcoded `model_supports_reasoning_summaries = true` (a key
Codex's schema has since dropped; see "Schema alignment") and
`model_reasoning_summary = "auto"`. That is correct for OpenAI o-series
models, which natively return reasoning summaries via the Responses API's
`reasoning.summary` field. It is **wrong by default for third-party models**
proxied through tingly-box:

- Most third-party providers don't implement `reasoning.summary`.
- tingly-box doesn't synthesize that field.
- With `model_supports_reasoning_summaries = true`, Codex requests a summary
  the upstream never returns → broken/odd behavior (this is the class of
  issue users hit in the field).

So `DefaultCodexPrefs()` now returns an **empty** struct — every knob unset,
deferring to Codex's own defaults. The frontend `defaultCodexPrefs()`
matches (`{}`), so the Quick form opens with all selects on `(default)` and
the "Force reasoning summaries" switch **off**. Users with a
reasoning-capable upstream can flip it on explicitly.

The same reasoning applies to the model catalog payload
(`RenderCodexModelCatalog`): per-entry `supports_reasoning_summaries` is
`false` and `default_reasoning_summary` is `"none"`, rather than the old
`true`/`"auto"`.

## 5. The model catalog toggle (issue #1027)

`~/.codex/tingly-model-catalog.json` is a tingly-managed file that Codex
reads on startup to populate the `/model` picker with tingly-served models.
`config.toml`'s `model_catalog_json` points at it.

**The bug (#1027):** users who took the Manual path — copying the
`config.toml` snippet or running the platform scripts — got a config that
referenced `model_catalog_json = '…/tingly-model-catalog.json'`, but the
catalog file itself was only written by the full "Auto Config" apply. The
reference dangled.

**The fix — an explicit `writeCatalog` flag, wired end to end:**

- Request: `ApplyCodexConfigRequest.WriteCatalog *bool` (nil → true, the
  backward-compatible default).
- `ApplyCodexConfig(baseURL, models, prefs, writeCatalog)` and
  `RenderCodexConfigTOML(..., writeCatalog)` both take the flag. When false,
  the catalog file is not written **and** `model_catalog_json` is omitted
  from the TOML — no dangling reference is ever produced.
- Preview response carries `catalogJson` (the rendered catalog) so the
  Manual tab can show it as **Step 3**, with TOML/Windows/Unix variants just
  like config.toml and auth.json. Copy-paste users now have the file's
  contents in front of them.

In the Quick tab this is a **switch** ("Write model catalog") under a
**Files** section, with a one-line explanation of what the file is for.

> **Why a toggle and not a separate "write catalog" button?** We considered
> a standalone weak button that writes only the catalog (for re-writing a
> deleted file without a full apply). It was cut as YAGNI: "Auto Config"
> already rewrites the catalog via merge-safe semantics, and the Manual
> Step 3 covers the copy-paste path. The toggle + Step 3 solve #1027 without
> a new endpoint.

Catalog **on** (default) — Manual shows Step 3 with the catalog JSON:

![Manual tab with catalog Step 3](images/codex-manual-catalog.png)

Catalog **off** — switch greyed, no Step 3, and the TOML drops
`model_catalog_json`:

![Manual tab without catalog](images/codex-manual-no-catalog.png)

## 6. Managed-field protection

`mergeCodexConfig` applies user prefs **first**, then writes the managed
fields, so managed fields always win even if a pref key somehow collided:

```
coerced := prefs.toConfig()      // whitelisted, validated
for k,v := range coerced { cfg[k] = v }

cfg["model"]            = models[0]          // managed, written after
cfg["model_provider"]   = "tingly-box"       // managed
cfg["model_catalog_json"] = catalogPath      // managed (only if writeCatalog)
cfg["model_providers"]["tingly-box"] = {…}    // managed: base_url, wire_api…
```

Everything else the user put in `config.toml` — unrelated top-level keys,
other `[model_providers.*]`, unrelated `[profiles.*]` — is preserved
(MERGE, not overwrite). The previous file is backed up before rewrite;
`agent restore codex` rolls back.

---

## 7. Apply notification completeness

The Apply success alert lists every file touched so the user knows exactly
what changed:

- `✓ Created/Updated ~/.codex/config.toml`
- `✓ Created/Updated ~/.codex/auth.json`
- `✓ Written ~/.codex/tingly-model-catalog.json` (only when the catalog was
  actually written — `ApplyCodexConfigResponse.CatalogWritten`, set to
  `writeCatalog && len(models) > 0`)
- the config backup path, when one was created

---

## 8. Wire shape

```jsonc
// POST /config/apply/codex  and  POST /config/preview/codex
{
  "preferences": {              // null → DefaultCodexPrefs() (all empty)
    "model_reasoning_effort": "high",
    "model_reasoning_summary": "",
    "model_verbosity": "",
    "supports_reasoning_summaries": ""
  },
  "writeCatalog": true          // null → true
}
```

Preview response adds `catalogJson` (present only when `writeCatalog` and
models exist); apply response adds `catalogWritten`.

> Per `CLAUDE.md`, the typed client SDK is codegen'd from swagger. The Codex
> calls in `frontend/src/services/api.ts` are hand-written `uiAPI(...)`
> wrappers (consistent with the existing Codex functions) until the next
> regen picks up the new request/response fields.

## 9. Key files

| Layer | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | `internal/config/apply_config.go` | `CodexPrefs`, `DefaultCodexPrefs`, `toConfig`, `ApplyCodexConfig`, `RenderCodexConfigTOML`, `RenderCodexModelCatalog`, `mergeCodexConfig` |
| Backend | `internal/server/module/configapply/{types,handler,routes}.go` | request/response shapes, apply + preview handlers, routes |
| Backend | `ai/agent/codex.go` | `CodexParams.{Prefs,WriteCatalog}`, `Apply()` |
| Backend | `internal/agent/rule_bridge.go` | CLI path (defaults + `WriteCatalog: true`) |
| Frontend | `frontend/src/pages/scenario/components/CodexQuickConfig.tsx` | field catalog + bilingual text + `writeCatalog` Files section |
| Frontend | `frontend/src/pages/scenario/components/CodexConfigModal.tsx` | Quick/Manual tabs, debounced preview, Step 3 catalog, apply alerts |
| Frontend | `frontend/src/pages/scenario/UseCodexPage.tsx` | page-level apply wiring |
| Frontend | `frontend/src/services/api.ts` | `applyCodexConfig`, `getCodexConfigPreview` |

---

## 10. Test coverage

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `internal/config/apply_config_test.go` | merge preserves user top-level keys / providers / profiles; managed fields overwritten; idempotent apply; colliding profile overwrite; catalog written + `model_catalog_json` set; reasoning presets are objects; no-models skips catalog; **`writeCatalog=false` skips catalog and drops `model_catalog_json`**; prefs applied top-level + per-profile; invalid enum / non-`true` bool dropped; prefs cannot clobber managed fields. |

Real-stack verification: Playwright + Chrome-for-Testing against a live
`tingly-box start --port 12580` backend through the vite dev proxy
confirms — Quick form opens at safe defaults (all `(default)`, force-summary
off, catalog on); changing reasoning effort reflects in the Manual TOML at
both top level and in every `[profiles.*]`; toggling the catalog switch
adds/removes Step 3 and the `model_catalog_json` line.

## Context-window headroom defaults (2026-10-19)

The managed model catalog (`tingly-model-catalog.json`) sets
`effective_context_window_percent = 82` (was 92; Codex's own default is 95)
and `auto_compact_token_limit = 75%` of the window (was 85%). Tingly-routed
third-party models spend more of the window on system prompt, tool overhead and
output than Codex's first-party models assume, so we reserve more headroom and
compact earlier. Compaction is always clamped to the effective percent so it
fires before the usable window is exhausted.

Both numbers are user-tunable in Auto Config (Quick tab, "Usable window" and
"Auto-compact at"). They ride in `CodexPrefs` as `effective_context_window_percent`
and `auto_compact_percent` (decimal strings, range 50–100, `""` = default) but are
**catalog-only**: `toConfig()` never writes them to `config.toml`. On reopen,
`ReadCodexConfig` restores non-default values from the applied catalog.

`model_reasoning_effort` accepts `max` and `ultra` in addition to the older
tiers — current Codex models advertise them in `supported_reasoning_levels`.

## Per-model auto-compact (rule flag `codex_compact_percent`)

The two headroom numbers above are shared by every catalog entry. Models differ
(200K vs a 1M rule, different upstreams), so a Codex rule can override the
auto-compact percent for its own model: `RuleFlags.CodexCompactPercent`
(50–100, `0` = follow the shared value). It is **config-only**: it is read when
the catalog is rendered (`BuildCompactPercentsFromRules` → `CodexPrefs.ModelAutoCompactPercent`,
`json:"-"` so a request can never set it) and never enters the request
pipeline, so it is deliberately not in `RuleFlagRegistry` (see `rule-flags.md`).

- **Ceiling.** A catalog entry's compact percent is `min(percent, usable-window
  percent)`. Codex is reported to ignore an auto-compact limit above 90% of the
  window (third-party write-ups, unconfirmed), but that is deliberately not
  enforced: the practical limit in use is lower than that anyway (see below), so
  the warnings carry the guidance and nothing is clamped at 90.
- **Editor.** A `Compact: 75% ▾` chip on the Codex rule header, next to `1M` and
  `Endpoint`, opens a popover with a slider (`CodexCompactChip`). Unset reads
  `Compact: Auto` and the popover shows the Auto Config value it follows; moving
  the slider sets the override, "use Auto Config value" clears it.
- **Slider layout.** The axis is labelled only at its ends (50% / 100%); zone
  boundaries are never placed as labels on the axis, because a boundary close to
  an end (96.4% on 1M) collides with the end label. The zones are painted on the
  slider's own rail so they line up with the thumb at any width: hatched from the
  usable-window percent up (values there still work, they are cut down), amber for
  the "too few tokens left" stretch below it (only when the usable window has been
  raised past it). A legend under the axis names each zone with its numbers.
- **Warning is about tokens left, not a fixed percent.** What compaction needs
  (summary request, system prompt, tool output, the reply) is roughly constant,
  so the popover warns when fewer than 36,000 tokens would remain, using the
  window the rule really has (1M with the `1M` flag, else 200K). 36,000 is the
  empirical limit: 82% of a 200K window. Larger windows reach it at a higher
  percent (96.4% on 1M). It is where warnings start, not a cap. The usable-window
  cut-down is explained instead of silently applied.
  `codexCompact.ts` mirrors the Go constants for the live preview; the server's
  clamp is what is written.
- **Read-back.** With overrides present the catalog no longer has one compact
  value, so `ReadCodexConfig` restores the most common one as the shared value.
- **Auto Config warns about the shared value too.** Under "Auto-compact at" the
  Quick tab shows the same judgement for the shared percent against the default
  200K window (a rule with the `1M` flag is judged on its own chip): an info line
  when the usable window cuts it down, a warning when under 36,000 tokens would
  remain. Typed values only; nothing is rewritten.
- **Not covered.** The agent-apply bridge (`ai/agent`, CLI/IM apply) renders its
  own catalog from default prefs and, like the `1M` window, does not carry rule
  overrides; the UI "Auto Config" path does. Whether the 36,000 threshold is
  right still wants a real long-session check against Codex.

## Schema alignment: `supports_reasoning_summaries` (2026-10-19)

The current upstream `config.schema.json` (root and `ConfigProfile` are
`additionalProperties: false`) no longer has `model_supports_reasoning_summaries`.
The per-model equivalent is the catalog entry's `supports_reasoning_summaries`,
so the "Force reasoning summaries" toggle is now the catalog-only pref
`supports_reasoning_summaries`: it sets that field on every entry of
`tingly-model-catalog.json` and is never written to `config.toml`.

- It therefore only takes effect when "Write model catalog" is on.
- Migration: `CodexPrefsFromConfig` still reads the legacy
  `model_supports_reasoning_summaries` key so an existing opt-in is not lost, and
  `mergeCodexConfig` deletes it from the top level on the next apply (managed
  profiles are rebuilt, so they never carry it). `ReadCodexConfig` also restores
  the pref from the applied catalog.

## Codex image tool: add a `gpt-image-2` rule (2026-11-05)

Codex's built-in `image_gen` tool posts to `{base_url}/images/generations` and `/images/edits` of the provider it runs against, always with model `gpt-image-2`. With the Tingly Box Codex config that is `/tingly/codex/images/*`, which the `codex` scenario now accepts (animated GIF output and the other formats: `image-output-formats.md`).

Quick Config does **not** create a rule for it. Add one by hand, or the tool gets a "not configured" error:

1. In the Codex scenario's rules, add a rule with request model `gpt-image-2` (a wildcard such as `gpt-image-*` also matches; rule matching is `MatchRuleByModelAndScenario`).
2. Point it at a Codex (ChatGPT OAuth) provider, model `gpt-image-2`.
3. For GIF, also turn on Codex's own flag (`[features] image_generation_animation = true`, off by default upstream). GIF is experimental: it was built from Codex's source and not yet captured live.
